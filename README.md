Batman Theme Trivia Game.

The trivia game shows only one question until the player answers it or time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, a messge will appear letting them know.  After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.


If the player runs out of time, the player will be informed that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer,  the player will be informed they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.


On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
